💡 **Why This Project?**
This project is a culmination of my learning journey through an intensive Django REST Framework course. It highlights my ability to design, build, and secure RESTful APIs following industry best practices. The course equipped me with essential backend development skills, from working with class-based views to implementing JWT authentication and custom signals.
